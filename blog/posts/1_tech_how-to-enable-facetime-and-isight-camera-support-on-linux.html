<h1 id="name">How to enable Facetime and iSight Camera support on Linux</h1>
<h3>The problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        Everyone knows of this problem. You just installed Linux on your new/old MacBook/iMac. Then you want to start, let's say a video conference and boom: Skype or whatever you're using says &quot;No device found&quot;. To fix this issue, I found <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/990218/camera-not-working-on-macbook-pro">this solution on StackExchange/AskUbuntu</a>. It didn't work completely fine for me, but I found <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1231340/trying-to-install-isight-webcam-following-instructions-but-module-bcd-pci-not?noredirect=1&lq=1">another post on StackExchange/AskUbuntu</a> which helped me out with the last problems. In this blogpost, I want to share my compared solution to enable Facetime/iSight Camera Support on Linux. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I used the instructions from the StackExchange posts above on Linux Mint 20.1 Cinnamon, on an early 2015 MacBook Pro &quot13. As Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu, and the instructions I followed actually were asked by an Ubuntu user, I suppose that these instructions will also work on Ubuntu. I didn't test this on other Linux distros.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        Copy the below code line by line into a terminal. How you do that is completely up to you, but make sure you copy it exactly as it's written below.
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        <pre>
sudo apt get install git
sudo apt-get install curl xzcat cpio
git clone https://github.com/patjak/facetimehd-firmware.git
cd facetimehd-firmware
make
sudo make install
cd ..
sudo apt-get install kmod libssl-dev checkinstall
git clone https://github.com/patjak/bcwc_pcie.git
cd bcwc_pcie
make
sudo make install
sudo depmod
sudo modprobe -r bdc_pci
sudo modprobe facetimehd
sudo nano /etc/modules</pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Within the file we opened in the last line from above, add &quot;facetimehd&quot; right at the end in a new line. Write out (&lt;CTRL&gt; + &lt;O&gt;), accept the filename (&lt;ENTER&gt;) and close (&lt;CTRL&gt; + &lt;X&gt;).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All that didn't perfectly work for me. Firstly, in line 2, I couldn't install the package &quot;xzcat&quot; because it wasn't found. A comment said that I had to install &quot;xz-utils&quot; instead of &quot;xzcat&quot;, but this packaget was already installed, so that's it. Secondly, I wasn't able to run line 14, because &quot;module bdc_pci wasn't found&quot;. With the help of another StackExchange/AskUbuntu post, I was able to find a solution for this, too. Install the following package:
                    </p>
                    <code><pre>
sudo apt-get install isight-firmware-tools</pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        During the course of the installation process, you will be asked for a firmware file. You can download such a file <a href="https://www.linux.org/attachments/appleusbvideosupport-zip.4683/">here</a>. Extract the downloaded zip archive and copy the included file to a spot you find it again. Then enter the path to that file where you were asked for it. When the installation successfully finished, you're ready to go.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just try out your camera right now. Even a reboot isn't required. For example open &quot;Cheese&quot;, and boom: iSight/Facetimehd!
                    </p>
                    <p> I hope these instructions will have worked for you. If you have have any questions, ideas what I could do better, please let me know.
