		<p>
			Hi, I'm Max, a 15 year old self taught software developer from Germany.
			<br>
			I started coding three years ago, in the March of 2018, when I found a book about LiveCode in my local city library. Of course, I got instantly infected by the coding virus and the book was borrowed by me for the rest of the year. Acquaintances with books on HTML and CSS followed, and during the course of the year I learned all of these coding languages pretty well (don 't judge me – I know that HTML and CSS aren't "real" coding languages, they 're markup languages). Over the months I learned lots of new things, discovered the german LiveCode forum and used some of the official LiveCode Lessons from their website quite often, why by the end of 2019, I had enough knowledge in LiveCode to bring nearly any project in that language to a point where you can use it quite well during a less amount of hours. In September 2020, I started learning Java, and I'm impressed how far you can get if you learn something regularly. I do work on a lot of projects at the moment, of which I 'll maybe present some on my YouTube channel (and here on my blog as well) in the future. So in the future, I want to practice my LiveCode, HTML, CSS and Java skills and want to learn JavaScript, Python and C.
